The source is [a survey published by National Institution For Youth Education of Japan in 2018 (Japanese)](https://www.niye.go.jp/kenkyu_houkoku/contents/detail/i/126/). You can read questionnaires [here](https://www.niye.go.jp/kanri/upload/editor/126/File/10_questionnaire_e.pdf) in English, and find Question 33 like below.\n\n![](images/question-33.png)\n\n## My hypothesis is that confusion has caused a surprise\n\nQuestion 33 is about relations with parents, teachers and friends. Left (\"Agree\") means positive and Right (\"Disagree\") means negative in most questionnaires, except h and i where Left and Right is reversed. You can see response results by country in columns and question in rows below.\n\nAs participants respond by question order, they tend to repeat the same response in successive questions. So some auto-correlation or momentum is moving vertically in below chart. My hypothesis is the U.S. participants are so positive and quick to answer that some of them may have missed the reversed meanings in questions h and i.\n\nHowever, I am not sure. Korean participants who are more positive than the U.S. didn't fall in the same trap in questions h and i. Difference of questionnaire structure by language may have affected.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# posts/2023-03-15-questionnaires-can-be-confusing-by-order/\n\nresults <- read_csv(\"data/q33results.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='2'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults |> \n  mutate(question = str_to_lower(question)) |> \n  pivot_longer(Japan:Korea, names_to = \"country\") |> \n  mutate(\n    country = factor(country,\n                     levels = c(\"US\", \"Japan\", \"China\", \"Korea\")),\n    res2 = factor(res2,\n                  levels = c(\"Agree\", \"Somewhat agree\",\n                             \"Somewhat disagree\", \"Disagree\"))\n  ) |> \n  ggplot(aes(res2, value)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = res2)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 50)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"RdBu\") +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(question), cols = vars(country)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Percent\") +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),\n    strip.background = element_blank(),\n    strip.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n    strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survey results by question and country](index_files/figure-html/fig-plot-1.png){#fig-plot width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n",
