This morning, as I do every morning, I opened [WHO stuation report page](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/), and found no new daily report. It looks like WHO have changed its situation report publish frequency from daily to weekly. Do I have to change my update frequency of [README.md](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/covid), and [shiny app](https://mitsuoxv.shinyapps.io/covid/) also to weekly?

Fortunately, by following the link to [WHO COVID-19 Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/) on the same page, I could find a csv file of daily data, which I have long hoped for. I can download it from [Data Table tab](https://covid19.who.int/table). Its URL is https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv.

I don't know when it became available. Anyway, the days of scratching numbers from pdf files are over. Thank you, WHO.
