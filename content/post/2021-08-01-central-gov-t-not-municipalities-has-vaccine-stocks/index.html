<p><a href="https://mitsuoxv.rbind.io/2021/07/17/do-some-municipalities-have-superfluous-stocks-of-pfizer-vaccines/">My previous post</a> was about the vaccine stock mystery. Central government says there must be 40M shots stocks, and <a href="https://www.fnn.jp/articles/-/211144">FNN reports</a> 40M shots stocks are 25M reserved for the second boost shots, 5M not-yet-reported shots, and 10M missing for unknown reasons. At that time, I thought at least 8M shots were not delivered to municipalities, if <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/vaccine_supply.html">“Prospects for Pfizer vaccine supplies” by MHLW (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) (japanese)</a> is correct.</p>
<p>And Nikkei reports <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA314080R30C21A7000000/">Minister Kono says municipalities have 25M shots of vaccine stocks, which are equivalent to one week shots (Japanese)</a> today (August 1, 2021). This is strange. One week shots are 1.2M per day times 7 days = 8.4M, far smaller than 25M.</p>
<p>I checked shot loss from the last diluted vial in my previous post, and found the loss would be less than 1M shots per month. This alone can’t explain the mystery.</p>
<p>In this post, I check EU export approvals based on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1352">EU transparency and authorisation mechanism</a> and <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/vaccine_supply.html">“Prospects for Pfizer vaccine supplies” by MHLW (japanese)</a>, and would like to claim the missing vaccine stocks are exported from EU but not yet delivered to municipalities, thus are in the hands of the central government.</p>
<div id="eu-export-approvals" class="section level2">
<h2>EU export approvals</h2>
<p>Shots are in millions. EU approved 100M shots by “2021-06-30”. An officer of the Cabinet Office assumes 12M among 100M shots are distributed to doctors, and the rest 88M are distributed to residents in <a href="https://japan.cnet.com/article/35174047/">CNET Japan: Gov’t provides an IT system to support 1.2M shots per day</a>. He also expects additional approvals by “2021-09-30” and “2021-12-31”.</p>

<p>Delivery is weekly up to “2021-04-26”, and bi-weekly from “2021-05-10”. So I move weekly delivery date to Wednesday, and bi-weekly delivery date to the second week Monday.</p>

<p>Then I combine “for_doctors_1”, “for_doctors_2” and “for_residents”, and calculate cumulative delivered boxes.</p>

<h2>Chart</h2>
<p>I assume straight line between EU approvals. I also assume 195 vials per box and 6 shots per vial.</p>
<p>MHLW has not yet scheduled domestic delivery from “2021-09-27” and beyond in its <a href="https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/vaccine_supply.html">“Prospects for Pfizer vaccine supplies” (japanese)</a>.</p>

<p>As of June 30, EU approved 100M shots exports, and cumulative domestic delivery was 91.2M shots. So 8.8M shots were undelivered stocks.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>delivered %&gt;%

<p>As of July 31, EU approval is 100 + 70 / 3 = 123.3M, proportionally, assuming EU approves additional 70M by the end of September. Cumulative domestic delivery is 115.8M shots. 7.5M shots are undelivered stocks.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I guess 10M missing shots for unknown reasons, which <a href="https://www.fnn.jp/articles/-/211144">FNN reported (Japanese)</a>, are mainly due to the time lag between EU export approval and domestic delivery. If I am right, it is not municipalities but the central government who has stocks.</p>
