<h2>Prof Morikawa’s article in Nikkei</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/English/faculty/morikawa.html">Prof Masayuki Morikawa at Hitotsubashi University</a> published an article titled <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCD275N90X20C22A1000000/">“We should emphasize soft infrastructure in government expenditures to enhance productivity” (Japanese)</a> in “Lecture on Economics” in Nikkei news paper on February 10, 2022. In his article he shows the chart which I will soon replicate, and suggests that higher debt may reduce economic growth rates.</p>

<h2>Get data from OECD Stats</h2>
<p>I follow “Alternative data-acquisition strategy” in <a href="https://github.com/expersso/OECD" class="uri">https://github.com/expersso/OECD</a>.</p>
<p>As Columbia and Turkey don’t have complete 12 data from 2008 to 2019 in general government debts per GDP, I drop them. Although Israel and South Korea lack 1 data, I keep them.</p>

<h2>Replicate the chart in the article</h2>
<p>He draws a scatter plot of government debts per GDP and economic growth rates from 2008 to 2019 (probably selected as the year of full employment) in OECD members.</p>
<p>Although he cautions that the relationship is correlation, not causation, he says that high government debts may reduce economic growth.</p>
<p>Although he labels only Japan, Greece, Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom and United States in the chart in his article, I label all countries here.</p>

<div id="replace-economic-growth-rates-with-productivity-gdp-per-hours-worked-growth-rates" class="section level2">
<h2>Replace economic growth rates with productivity (GDP per hours worked) growth rates</h2>
<p>As this article is about how to enhance productivity by fiscal expentitures, and Japan economic growth is suffering from decreasing population and labor force, I replace economic growth rates with productivity (GDP per hours worked) growth rates. The slope of the linear regression line is now flatter.</p>

<div id="exclude-euro-countries-except-germany-and-separate-into-two-charts-by-whether-oecd-original-member-or-not" class="section level2">
<h2>Exclude Euro countries except Germany and separate into two charts by whether OECD original member or not</h2>
<p>As Euro countries, like Greece and Italy, don’t borrow in its own currency but in the euro, and were forced into austerity by Germany from 2008 to 2019, I exclude Euro countries except Germany. I also exclude Denmark as its currency is pegged to the euro. As a result, I just consider the relationship between gov’t debts in its own currency and productivity growth.</p>
<p>I also separate the OECD countries by whether they are the original members or not, to take account of the development stages by each country.</p>
<p>Now there is no relationship between gov’t debts and productivity growth. Am I cherry picking the data? I believe not.</p>
