I read [the tweet by Paul Krugman on the inflation difference between US and Euro](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1458575034969174019). Why is the US inflation is now 2 percent higher than Euro? He thinks the difference can be explained by gasoline.

So I have done [a rough calculation](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/cpi-inflation). To my surprise, my calculation does not support his claim. Excluding gasoline does not shrink the difference. My choice of "gasoline" might not be appropriate, or my use of the fixed component share might be a problem. I will wait for validation by someone.
