I would like to know the effects of the tariffs on US imports from China. So I have got data from [Census Bureau U.S. International Trade Data](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/), and made ["us-tariffs-on-china" repo](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/us-tariffs-on-china) in my GitHub. Chinese shares rise just before the tariff effective dates, and decline thereafter, as I expected. I am somewhat surprised to know that the USTR has chosen lower-Chinese-share goods first to impose tariffs.
