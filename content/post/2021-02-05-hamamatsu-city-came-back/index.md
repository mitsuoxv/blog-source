I have just done an annual update of ["City competition to consume in Japan"](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/jp-household/blob/master/README.md). This is the second annual update. The latest year is now 2020.

[Hamamatsu-city lost the top position both in consuming dumplings and grilled eel in 2019](https://mitsuoxv.rbind.io/2020/02/07/hamamatsu-city-defeated/). It came back to the top in both in 2020. Congratulations, Hamamatsu-city!

If you can read Japanese, try my [shiny app](https://mitsuoxv.shinyapps.io/jp-household/). For example, select item level 5, select "282 納豆", and you can see how divided Japan is.
