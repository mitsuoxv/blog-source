I was watching News Center 9, an NHK nightly news program, on December 16. It told suicide cases have been rapidly surging since July 2020 in Japan. It showed a chart which displays January to December in x axis, number of cases in y axis, and two lines of 2020 and Mean (2017-2019). While the line Mean (2017-2019) has downward slope, the line of 2020 has a rapid upward slope. Two lines cross around June. 

You can see the chart I replicated, and a more simple time series chart since 2008 in ["Japan suicide cases reported by National Police Agency"](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/jp-suicide). It turned out that suicide cases had been declining since 2010, but bottomed out in early 2020. I suspect that discovery delay in the Covid-19 emergency period has caused some downs in spring and ups thereafter, and that the surge is not as fast as the NHK program suggests.
