I managed to finish scratching numbers from WHO situation reports (pdf) from #1 to #50, added [README.md](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/covid), and updated [my shiny app](https://mitsuoxv.shinyapps.io/covid/). China is succeeding to contain the virus, and now the areas outside China face the challenge.

I also put table1.csv (in China data) and table2.csv (outside China data) in [the data directory in my GitHub repo](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/covid/tree/master/data), thinking these csv files may be useful to someone. I will try to update, but I am not sure if I can, as WHO constantly changes table formats. I hope WHO will publish their situation report tables in csv files.
