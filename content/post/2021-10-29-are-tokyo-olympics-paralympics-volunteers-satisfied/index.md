NHK News Watch 9 on October 29, 2021 surprised me by [the last news (Japanese)](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211029/amp/k10013327081000.html), which reports that more than 70 percent of volunteers of Tokyo Olympics-Paralympics feel their causes to join volunteers have been fulfilled. Survey is done by the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG). 11,893 persons among all 70,000 volunteers have responded.

Response rate is 17 percent. I guess most unsatisfied volunteers have not responded. TOCOG may be OK with the survey results, which actually mean nothing. If TOCOG really wants to get meaningful results, it should not have tried complete census, instead should have selected around 200 random samples and tried to get high response rates.

And NHK should not have reported the TOCOG survey uncritically.
