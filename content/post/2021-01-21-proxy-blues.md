They Say It Will Work

It Won't Work

Don't Be Noisy

Hate Proxy

I am writing this post from my Company PC (Panasonic notebook with Windows 10), which connects to the Internet via a proxy server with authentication. I am required to change my password every 3 month. I got the mail to do so today, so I just changed my password.

Then I must modify several setting files for data science tools, like R, Git, conda, and Jupyter Notebook. I will show you how I modify below.

Suppose my ID is MYID, my password is MYPW, and the proxy server (domain:port number, like xxx.xxx.xxx:xx) is PROXY. In my case, as the proxy server is set by .pac file, I have to ask IT Department to get the proxy server.

`.Renviron` in `Documents`

Don't forget to [URL encode](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP) MYPW.

```
# Proxy setting
http_proxy=http://MYID:MYPW@PROXY

https_proxy=http://MYID:MYPW@PROXY
```

`.Rprofile` in `Documents`

I have to set `download.file.method` as "libcurl".

```
# Start-up options
options(internet.info = 0)

options(download.file.method = "libcurl")
```

`.bash_profile` in (a kind of) Home (in my case, one stage upper of `Documents`)

Don' forget to [escape special characters](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/1565923472/ch01s09.html) in MYPW, if any.

```
# generated by Git for Windows
test -f ~/.profile && . ~/.profile
test -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

CONNECT_USER=MYID

CONNECT_PASSWORD=MYPW

export CONNECT_USER CONNECT_PASSWORD
```

`.gitconfig` in Home

URL encode MYPW.

```
[http]
 	proxy = http://MYID:MYPW@PROXY
[https]
 	proxy = http://MYID:MYPW@PROXY
```

`.condarc` in Home

URL encode MYPW.

```
channels:
  - defaults

proxy_servers:
  http: http://MYID:MYPW@PROXY
  https: http://MYID:MYPW@PROXY

ssl_verify: false
report_errors: false
```

`00-startup.py` in `startup` in `profile_default` in `.ipython` in Home

URL encode MYPW.

`
os.environ['HTTP_PROXY'] = "http://MYID:MYPW@PROXY"
os.environ['HTTPS_PROXY'] = "http://MYID:MYPW@PROXY"
`

Is everything OK? Unfortunately no. In RStudio, Git Pull or Push button never works for me. I go around this issue by typing git commands in Tools > Shell. I just hate proxy.
