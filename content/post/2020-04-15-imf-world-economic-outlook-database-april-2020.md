I updated [my shiny app](https://mitsuoxv.shinyapps.io/imf-weo/), based on the newly released IMF World Economic Outlook Database. I first thought there must be some coding errors, as the forecast extended only to 2021, not 2024 of the previous version. However, it turned out IMF decided to forecast just up to 2021, due to the high level of uncertainty. "Concepts" you can choose are also limited.

I hope this uncertainty surrounding our lives will subside soon.
