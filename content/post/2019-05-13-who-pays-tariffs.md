On May 11, 2019, [Japanese newspaper Nikkei reported that China pays most of the tariffs](https://r.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO44628380Q9A510C1MM8000?s=3).

[I have checked](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/us-tariffs-on-china/blob/master/Who-pays.md) how US import price from China changed from 2018 Q2, just before the first tranche “34b” became effective, for each HTS 10 digit code item, and compared the changes by tariff schedule category. Basically, I disagree with the Nikkei report.
