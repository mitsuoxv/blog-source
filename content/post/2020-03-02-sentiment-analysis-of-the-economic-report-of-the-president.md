I tried [sentiment analysis of the economic report of the president](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/erp/blob/master/Sentiment.md). I owe much to Len Kiefer, as I learned the techniques of sentiment analysis from his [“Text Mining Fedspeak”](http://lenkiefer.com/2018/07/28/text-mining-fedspeak/), and the techniques to draw recession shaded areas from his ["Plotting U.S. Macroeconomic Trends with FRED and R"](http://lenkiefer.com/2017/12/11/plotting-u-s-macroeconomic-trends-with-fred-and-r/).

The conclusion is not surprising. The sentiments of the presidents usually fall in or after the recession.
