Hello, world. This is a web site of a would-be data scientist, named Mitsuo Shiota. I began to self-learn R one and half years ago in order to get the assigned job done. In that job, I had to deal with massive data. I gave up Excel, and picked up R. Fortunately I encountered an excellent book, ["R for Data Science"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, so my journey for data science began.

In this web site, I will mainly do some economic analyses by using R and tidyverse.
