After [I confirmed each tariff list of USTR really covers 34, 16 and 200 billion dollars imports from China](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/us-tariffs-on-china), I have turned to Chinese claims that their retaliation tariff list covers 3, 34, 16 and 60 billion dollar imports from the US. As China imports from the US are the US exports to China, I can use the same [Census Bureau U.S. International Trade Data](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/) to confirm their claims.

And my calculation suggests that [the Chinese hit-backs are half the size of their claims ](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/us-tariffs-on-china/China-hits-back.md) . My guess is that they calculated the size based on HTS 6 digit codes, while they actually impose tariffs based on both 6 and 8 digit codes.
