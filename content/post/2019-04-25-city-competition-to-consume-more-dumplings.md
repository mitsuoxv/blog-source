[This](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/jp-household) is a pilot project to utilize [estatapi package by yutannihilation](https://github.com/yutannihilation/estatapi/blob/master/README.en.md) and [e-Stat](https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en).

I have downloaded data of [Family Income and Expenditure Survey](https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kakei/) by the Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and analyzed which city, among 52 cities in Japan, consumed most dumplings per household from 2007 to 2018. Then I have turned to find specialty goods which some cities have persistently consumed most. I have also ranked cities in their consumption in 2018 by each item (499 items in total), and looked at the ranks distribution by each city, which may have been affected by price level differences.
