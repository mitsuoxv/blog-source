We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality. The WMD projection we now use, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it accounts for these year-to-year trends.\"\n\nThe Economist [claims it uses a model to estimate excess deaths](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-the-economist-global-excess-deaths-model).
