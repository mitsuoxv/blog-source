French Guiana and Jersey are duplicated.\n\nFrom the grand total, I know total new_conf of Kosovo and Puerto Rico is 139. I speculate 69 for Kosovo, and 70 for Puerto Rico. I have to correct them later.\n\nUpdate:\nI re-downloaded No. 142 at 7:37 am, June 12, Japan Time, and found it was corrected. Thank you, WHO. It turned out that new_conf was 0 for Kosovo, and 139 for Puerto Rico.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nEvery morning, I update [Covid-19, WHO situation report](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/covid), and [shiny app](https://mitsuoxv.shinyapps.io/covid/).\n\nThis morning, WHO situation report was No. 142, which I downloaded at 7:43 am, June 11, Japan Time.
