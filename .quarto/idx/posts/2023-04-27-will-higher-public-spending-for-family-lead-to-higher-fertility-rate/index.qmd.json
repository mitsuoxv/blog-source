Title is \"Correlation between public expenditure for family and fertility rate in OECD countries.\" X-axis is percent ratio of public expenditure for family to GDP in 2017, and Y-axis is fertility rate in 2021. Red point is Japan. I find 34 points in the figure.\n\n![Quoted figure titled correlation between public expenditure for family and fertility rate](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-04-28%2009-05-19.png){#fig-screenshot fig-alt=\"Quoted figure titled correlation between public expenditure for family and fertility rate\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\nThen, they make a causal statement, \"1 percent of GDP (5 trillion yen) increase in public expenditure for family leads to 0.05 to 0.1 increase in fertility rate. This estimate is based on 30 OECD countries data since 2010\".\n\nI have got confused. Do they think this figure, which does not show confidence interval, suggests correlation? And, even if it does, do they think they can morph correlation into causality by more samples from multiple years? So I have decided to get data from OECD.stat.\n\n## Replicate the quoted figure\n\n```{r}\n#| label: get_data\n#| warning: false\n\n# OECD 38 countries\noecd_countries <- c(\"ISR\", \"LUX\", \"NLD\", \"GRC\", \"ISL\", \"LVA\", \"SVN\", \"FRA\", \"POL\", \"TUR\", \"ESP\", \"BEL\", \"MEX\", \"IRL\", \"CHE\", \"FIN\", \"CHL\", \"CAN\", \"KOR\", \"NZL\", \"AUS\", \"HUN\", \"USA\", \"GBR\", \"AUT\", \"SWE\", \"DNK\", \"SVK\", \"CZE\", \"COL\", \"JPN\", \"NOR\",\"CRI\", \"LTU\", \"DEU\", \"EST\", \"PRT\", \"ITA\")\n\n# \"OAVG\" OECD average\nfamily <- get_dataset(\n  \"FAMILY\",\n  filter = list(c(oecd_countries, \"OAVG\"), \"TOTAL\", c(\"FAM1\", \"FAM3\")),\n  start_time = 1990, end_time = 2021\n  ) |> \n  clean_names() |> \n  mutate(\n    obs_value = parse_number(obs_value),\n    time = parse_number(time)\n    )\n\n# \"OECD\" OECD average\nfamily_expenditure <- get_dataset(\n  \"SOCX_AGG\",\n  filter = list(\"10\", \"5\", \"0\", \"0\", \"PCT_GDP\", c(oecd_countries, \"OECD\")),\n  start_time = 1980, end_time = 2021\n  ) |> \n  clean_names() |> \n  mutate(\n    obs_value = if_else(obs_value == \"NaN\", NA, obs_value),\n    obs_value = parse_number(obs_value),\n    time = parse_number(time)\n    )\n\n# fertility rate vs public family expenditure; point\nfer_vs_exp <- family |> \n  filter(ind == \"FAM1\", time == 2021) |> \n  select(cou, fertility = obs_value) |> \n  mutate(cou = if_else(cou == \"OAVG\", \"OECD\", cou)) |> \n  left_join(family_expenditure |> \n              filter(time == 2017) |> \n              select(cou = country, fam_exp = obs_value),\n            by = \"cou\") |> \n  mutate(\n    country = if_else(cou == \"OECD\",\n                      \"OECD average\",\n                      countrycode(cou, \"iso3c\", \"country.name\"))\n  )\n\nfer_vs_exp2 <- fer_vs_exp |>\n  filter(cou != \"OECD\")\n```\n\nI plot the replicated chart below with confidence interval.
