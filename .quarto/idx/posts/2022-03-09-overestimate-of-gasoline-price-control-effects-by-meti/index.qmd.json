METI transforms Dubai crude oil prices from dollar per barrel to yen per liter based on yen-dollar exchange rates, and estimates the subsidy effect by comparing the weekly average of Dubai crude oil price in yen from February 22 to 28 with the gasoline retail price in yen on March 7. So, METI assumes Dubai spot crude oil will be sent to Japan, converted into gasoline, and sold to consumers in 10 days. I think it is too short.
