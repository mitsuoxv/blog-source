Left (\"Agree\") means positive and Right (\"Disagree\") means negative in most questionnaires, except h and i where Left and Right is reversed. You can see response results by country in columns and question in rows below.\n\nAs participants respond by question order, they tend to repeat the same response in successive questions. So some auto-correlation or momentum is moving vertically in below chart. My hypothesis is the U.S. participants are so positive and quick to answer that some of them may have missed the reversed meanings in questions h and i.\n\nHowever, I am not sure. Korean participants who are more positive than the U.S. didn't fall in the same trap in questions h and i.
