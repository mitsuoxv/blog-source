Central government says there must be 40M shots stocks, and [FNN reports](https://www.fnn.jp/articles/-/211144) 40M shots stocks are 25M reserved for the second boost shots, 5M not-yet-reported shots, and 10M missing for unknown reasons. At that time, I thought at least 8M shots were not delivered to municipalities, if [\"Prospects for Pfizer vaccine supplies\" by MHLW (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) (japanese)](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/vaccine_supply.html) is correct.\n\nAnd Nikkei reports [Minister Kono says municipalities have 25M shots of vaccine stocks, which are equivalent to one week shots (Japanese)](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA314080R30C21A7000000/) today (August 1, 2021). This is strange. One week shots are 1.2M per day times 7 days = 8.4M, far smaller than 25M.\n\nI checked shot loss from the last diluted vial in my previous post, and found the loss would be less than 1M shots per month. This alone can't explain the mystery.\n\nIn this post, I check EU export approvals based on [EU transparency and authorisation mechanism](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1352) and [\"Prospects for Pfizer vaccine supplies\" by MHLW (japanese)](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/vaccine_supply.html), and would like to claim the missing vaccine stocks are exported from EU but not yet delivered to municipalities, thus are in the hands of the central government.\n\n\nShots are in millions. EU approved 100M shots by \"2021-06-30\". An officer of the Cabinet Office assumes 12M among 100M shots are distributed to doctors, and the rest 88M are distributed to residents in [CNET Japan: Gov't provides an IT system to support 1.2M shots per day](https://japan.cnet.com/article/35174047/).
