To claim this relationship is not just association but causal, the authors use instrumental variables, which are (1) mortality of European colonial settlers, (2) population density in the 1500s, (3) availability of crops and minerals, (4) fraction of the population speaking English and a Western European language and (5) legal origin.\n\nAs I happen to be reading [\"Statistical Rethinking, 2nd Edition\" by Richard McElreath, CRC Press, 2020](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/), I would like to show instrumental variable strategy in the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) as below.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-dag1\n#| fig-cap: No path from V to G except via D\n#| fig-align: center\n\ndag_intended <- dagitty(\"dag{\n                  U [unobserved]\n                  D <- U -> G\n                  V -> D\n                  D -> G\n                  }\")\ncoordinates(dag_intended) <- list(x = c(V = 0, D = 1, U = 2, G = 3),\n                               y = c(V = 0, D = 1, U = 0, G = 1))\nrethinking::drawdag(dag_intended)\n```\n\nV: Instrumental variable\n\nD: Democracy index\n\nG: GDP growth rate\n\nU: Unobserved confound on D and G\n\nThis strategy aims to estimate the direct effect from D to G.
