As the export market shrank, plant investment stagnated.\n\nIn southern Europe in the early 2000s, joining Euro prompted capital inflow and lower interest rate, and credit and asset boom. However, productivity growth was lower and inflation was higher than in Germany, so real exchange rate appreciated, and plant investment stagnated. It led to bigger deficits in current account balance and in target 2 balance, which is equivalent to foreign reserves in the fixed exchange rate regime, and eventually debt crisis.\n\nIn both cases, increased capital inflow (or less capital outflow in Japan case) caused lower real interest rates and higher real exchange rates.
