If they are bond vigilantes, they should have sold more sterling pounds, when the Bank of England intervened the bond market to buy bonds on September 28. They should have seen this intervention as a sign of fiscal dominance, in which the BoE would lose independence from the government, monetize fiscal deficits, and allow inflation to accelerate.

As defined benefit pension funds have long-term fixed payment liability, they are vulnerable for interest rate changes. So they make an LDI derivative contract with financial institutions like Black Rock, which is basically an interest rate swap to have additional fixed income assets and variable payment liabilities in effect. With this contract, if interest rates go down, the present value of original long-term liabilities increases and that of new variable payment liabilities is unchanged, while, on the asset side, the present value of original and new fixed income assets increase. As both sides of asset and liability equally increase in the present value, balance is unchanged in total. If interest rates go up, both sides shrink, and balance is unchanged as well. LDI is a strategy to avoid exposure to interest rate change risks.\n\nSounds good. But, a hitch is that an amount of cash, which pension funds must hand to derivative contractors as a collateral, changes in real time as interest rates move, as new asset and new liability created by a contract does not balance in the present value. On September 23, interest rates began to rise, as Prime Minister Truss's plan was bigger than the market had expected. Derivative contractors began to require more cash to pension funds. As pension funds didn't hold enough cash at hand, they began to sell some assets, mainly government bonds, to get cash. Prices of government bonds decreased, and interest rates rose. This positive feedback continued and people in the market got panic, until the BoE intervened the bond market. People in panic tend to buy US dollars, just as they did when Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. They again bought US dollars, and sold UK sterling pounds.\n\nAs pension funds are solvent, the BoE expects they have enough cash at hand by October 14. We shall see soon.\n\nWhat lesson should the Japanese government learn? If I am right, forget about bond vigilantes.
