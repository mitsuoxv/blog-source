Prof Kojima warns against repeated vaccine shots by suggesting there is a synchronized movement between 3rd vaccine shots and cumulative excess deaths from January to March 2022. However, his warning does not sound persuasive, because it assumes immediate effects of vaccine shots on deaths, and it depends on just 3 months data.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-p1_p2\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| fig-cap: \n#|   - 3rd vaccine shots in Japan\n#|   - Excess deaths in Japan\n#| message: false\n\nvaccine_jp_ratio %>% \n  filter(order == \"3rd\", date >= \"2022-01-01\", date < \"2022-04-01\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(date, shots)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Cululative shots per population\",\n       color = \"Order of shots\",\n       title = \"3rd vaccine shots in Japan\",\n       caption = \"Source: Digital Agency\")\n\ncum_end_of_2021 <- economist_estimates_jp %>% \n  filter(date == \"2021-12-27\") %>% \n  pull(cumulative_estimated_daily_excess_deaths)\n\neconomist_estimates_jp %>% \n  filter(date >= \"2022-01-01\", date < \"2022-04-01\") %>% \n  mutate(excess_deaths_2022 = cumulative_estimated_daily_excess_deaths - cum_end_of_2021) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(date, excess_deaths_2022)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Cumulative deaths since 2022\",\n       title = \"Excess deaths in Japan\",\n       caption = \"Source: The Economist\")\n```\n\nWhen we broaden the time horizon, it is hard to notice synchronized movement between vaccine shots and cumulative excess deaths.

It turns out projected deaths from 2020 are linear extrapolation from 2015-2019 deaths in World Mortality Dataset (WMD) which [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/excess_mortality) uses.\n\n> \"Before 20 September 2021, we calculated P-scores using a different estimate of expected deaths: the five-year average from 2015–2019. We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality. The WMD projection we now use, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it accounts for these year-to-year trends.\"\n\nThe Economist [claims it uses a model to estimate excess deaths](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-the-economist-global-excess-deaths-model). As its estimates are larger than WMD in Japan, it is likely that the Economist does not age-adjust normal deaths projection either.\n\nAs projection is not age-adjusted, it is more plausible that projection is too low than that actual deaths are too high in 2022. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-actual_projection\n#| fig-cap: Actual deaths and projection by the Economist\n#| fig-align: center\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nseasonality <- excess_mortality_jp %>% \n  filter(!is.na(average_deaths_2015_2019_all_ages)) %>% \n  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% \n  select(month, average_deaths_2015_2019_all_ages) %>% \n  mutate(seasonality = average_deaths_2015_2019_all_ages - mean(average_deaths_2015_2019_all_ages)) %>% \n  select(month, seasonality)\n\nactual_2015_2019 <- excess_mortality_jp %>% \n  filter(!is.na(deaths_2015_all_ages)) %>% \n  select(date, deaths_2015_all_ages:deaths_2019_all_ages) %>% \n  pivot_longer(-date, names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"actual\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    month = month(date),\n    year = year %>% \n      str_sub(8, 11) %>% \n      as.integer()\n    ) %>% \n  select(-date) %>% \n  left_join(seasonality, by = \"month\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    actual_sa = actual - seasonality,\n    date = make_yearmonth(year, month)\n    ) %>% \n  select(-year, -month) %>% \n  arrange(date)\n\nactual_since_2020 <- excess_mortality_jp %>% \n  filter(!is.na(deaths_since_2020_all_ages)) %>% \n  select(date, actual = deaths_since_2020_all_ages) %>% \n  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% \n  left_join(seasonality, by = \"month\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    actual_sa = actual - seasonality,\n    date = yearmonth(date)\n    ) %>% \n  select(-month)\n\nprojected_since_2020 <- excess_mortality_jp %>% \n  filter(!is.na(projected_deaths_since_2020_all_ages)) %>% \n  select(date, projected = projected_deaths_since_2020_all_ages) %>% \n  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% \n  left_join(seasonality, by = \"month\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    projected_sa = projected - seasonality,\n    date = yearmonth(date)\n    ) %>% \n  select(-month)\n\nbind_rows(actual_2015_2019, actual_since_2020) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(date, actual_sa)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_line(aes(date, projected_sa), data = projected_since_2020,\n            color = \"blue\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", data = actual_2015_2019, se = FALSE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Monthly deaths in Japan\\nseasonally adjusted\\nby using 2015-2019 average additively\",\n     title = \"Actual deaths surpass projection in 2022\",\n     subtitle = \"Black is actual, and blue is projection; linear extrapolation from 2015-2019\",\n     caption = \"Note: Excess deaths are estimated by WMD\\nSource: Our World In Data\")\n```\n\nProjection by WMD is age-adjusted in below 35 locations.

Prof Kojima warns against repeated vaccine shots by suggesting there is a synchronized movement between 3rd vaccine shots and cumulative excess deaths from January to March 2022. However, his warning does not sound persuasive, because it assumes immediate effects of vaccine shots on deaths, and it depends on just 3 months data.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-p1_p2\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n#| fig-cap: \n#|   - 3rd vaccine shots in Japan\n#|   - Excess deaths in Japan\n#| message: false\n\nvaccine_jp_ratio %>% \n  filter(order == \"3rd\", date >= \"2022-01-01\", date < \"2022-04-01\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(date, shots)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Cululative shots per population\",\n       color = \"Order of shots\",\n       title = \"3rd vaccine shots in Japan\",\n       caption = \"Source: Digital Agency\")\n\ncum_end_of_2021 <- economist_estimates_jp %>% \n  filter(date == \"2021-12-27\") %>% \n  pull(cumulative_estimated_daily_excess_deaths)\n\neconomist_estimates_jp %>% \n  filter(date >= \"2022-01-01\", date < \"2022-04-01\") %>% \n  mutate(excess_deaths_2022 = cumulative_estimated_daily_excess_deaths - cum_end_of_2021) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(date, excess_deaths_2022)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Cumulative deaths since 2022\",\n       title = \"Excess deaths in Japan\",\n       caption = \"Source: The Economist\")\n```\n\nWhen we broaden the time horizon, it is hard to notice synchronized movement between vaccine shots and cumulative excess deaths.

It turns out projected deaths from 2020 are linear extrapolation from 2015-2019 deaths in World Mortality Dataset (WMD) which [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/excess_mortality) uses.\n\n> \"Before 20 September 2021, we calculated P-scores using a different estimate of expected deaths: the five-year average from 2015–2019. We made this change because using the five-year average has an important limitation — it does not account for year-to-year trends in mortality and thus can misestimate excess mortality. The WMD projection we now use, on the other hand, does not suffer from this limitation because it accounts for these year-to-year trends.\"\n\nThe Economist [claims it uses a model to estimate excess deaths](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-the-economist-global-excess-deaths-model). As its estimates are larger than WMD in Japan, it is likely that the Economist does not age-adjust normal deaths projection either.\n\nAs projection is not age-adjusted, it is more plausible that projection is too low than that actual deaths are too high in 2022. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-actual_projection\n#| fig-cap: Actual deaths and projection by the Economist\n#| fig-align: center\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nseasonality <- excess_mortality_jp %>% \n  filter(!is.na(average_deaths_2015_2019_all_ages)) %>% \n  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% \n  select(month, average_deaths_2015_2019_all_ages) %>% \n  mutate(seasonality = average_deaths_2015_2019_all_ages - mean(average_deaths_2015_2019_all_ages)) %>% \n  select(month, seasonality)\n\nactual_2015_2019 <- excess_mortality_jp %>% \n  filter(!is.na(deaths_2015_all_ages)) %>% \n  select(date, deaths_2015_all_ages:deaths_2019_all_ages) %>% \n  pivot_longer(-date, names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"actual\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    month = month(date),\n    year = year %>% \n      str_sub(8, 11) %>% \n      as.integer()\n    ) %>% \n  select(-date) %>% \n  left_join(seasonality, by = \"month\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    actual_sa = actual - seasonality,\n    date = make_yearmonth(year, month)\n    ) %>% \n  select(-year, -month) %>% \n  arrange(date)\n\nactual_since_2020 <- excess_mortality_jp %>% \n  filter(!is.na(deaths_since_2020_all_ages)) %>% \n  select(date, actual = deaths_since_2020_all_ages) %>% \n  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% \n  left_join(seasonality, by = \"month\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    actual_sa = actual - seasonality,\n    date = yearmonth(date)\n    ) %>% \n  select(-month)\n\nprojected_since_2020 <- excess_mortality_jp %>% \n  filter(!is.na(projected_deaths_since_2020_all_ages)) %>% \n  select(date, projected = projected_deaths_since_2020_all_ages) %>% \n  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% \n  left_join(seasonality, by = \"month\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    projected_sa = projected - seasonality,\n    date = yearmonth(date)\n    ) %>% \n  select(-month)\n\nbind_rows(actual_2015_2019, actual_since_2020) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(date, actual_sa)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_line(aes(date, projected_sa), data = projected_since_2020,\n            color = \"blue\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", data = actual_2015_2019, se = FALSE) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Monthly deaths in Japan\\nseasonally adjusted\\nby using 2015-2019 average additively\",\n     title = \"Actual deaths surpass projection in 2022\",\n     subtitle = \"Black is actual, and blue is projection; linear extrapolation from 2015-2019\",\n     caption = \"Note: Excess deaths are estimated by WMD\\nSource: Our World In Data\")\n```\n\nProjection by WMD is age-adjusted in below 35 locations.
