CNBC recently added [\"States cutting unemployment benefits didn’t get people back to work, study finds\" on July 22](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/cuts-to-unemployment-benefits-didnt-get-people-back-to-work-study-finds.html). \n\nThe second news showed Trump claiming election fraud at Fulton county in Georgia at his rally, and then it reported that 17 Republican-led state legislatures changed voting entitlement more strict, claiming their purpose was to prevent such election frauds.

So NHK reports what Republicans say as a fact, even if it is an ideology, a pretense, or a white lie.
