I have updated [US tariffs on China](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/us-tariffs-on-china).

As I have found USTR grants product exclusions from tariffs in [the USTR page](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/enforcement/section-301-investigations/section-301-china/record-section-301), I have added the new category "excl" which are granted to be excluded by USTR. If I calculate based on HTS 10 digit codes, granted exclusions amount to 9.8 among tariff-imposed 34 billion dollars imports so far.

As Chinese shares in the products which are not imposed tariffs are as high as those of “excl”, I expect that USTR will receive massive product exclusion requests, if they impose tariffs on them.
