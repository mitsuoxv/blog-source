Yesterday I noticed [my analysis on who pays tariffs in US imports from China](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/us-tariffs-on-china/blob/master/Who-pays.md) is totally incompatible with [the import price movement in total](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNTOT).

Today I added correction to my analysis. I guess my mistake came from unit revision by Census bureau at the start of the year, which generated a lot of zero price indices.

This is my second major correction. My first one was about [China retaliation values] (https://mitsuoxv.rbind.io/posts/2019-06-21-correction-china-hits-back-as-much-as-the-size-of-its-claim/), and I learned that Harmonized Tariff Schedule is not harmonized at some level.

This time I have learned unit in US trade data may be different over years. In added correction, I just removed zero values and zero price indices. This is tentative correction. I may have to find out how to keep unit consistency.
