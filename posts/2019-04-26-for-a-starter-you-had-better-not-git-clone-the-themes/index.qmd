I am happy to arrive here at rbind.io via netlify.com. But I nearly failed because of [netlify-recognizes-theme-as-submodule issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53625208/failing-to-deploy-website-on-netlify-when-trying-to-use-alternate-hexo-theme).

I am a starter of Git and GitHub, just use Git as some sort of FTP, don't know what submodules mean. I struggled to remove .git in the theme directory. In the end, I deleted the theme directory, newly downloaded zip theme files, and it worked. So, if you are a starter like me, don't git clone the themes, instead download zip.
