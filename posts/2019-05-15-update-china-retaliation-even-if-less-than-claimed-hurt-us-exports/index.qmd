I added some findings to ["China-hits-back"](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/us-tariffs-on-china/blob/master/China-hits-back.md). I am now less sure, but still keep my guess that China calculated the retaliation size based on HS 6 digit codes, while they actually impose tariffs based on both 6 and 8 digit codes. And I added a chart to show US exports are hurt, more on retaliated items, less on non-retaliated items.
