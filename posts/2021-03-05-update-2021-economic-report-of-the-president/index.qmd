I have updated ["Tf-idf analysis"](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/erp/blob/master/README.md) and ["Sentiment analysis"](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/erp/blob/master/Sentiment.md) of the Economic Report of the President, by adding the 2021 report.

Tf-idf analysis shows that the economic aspects in the last 4 years, from 2017 to 2020 under Trump Presidency, can be characterized by "cyber", "ai", "opioids" and "covid".

Sentiment analysis shows that sentiment is worsening under the recession which began in February 2020.
