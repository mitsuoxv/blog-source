Today, I migrated from Blogdown/Hugo to Quarto.
I basically followed [an article by Art Steinmetz in r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/01/switching-to-quarto-from-blogdown/).
Thank you, Art.

What pushed me for migration was `code-fold` and `code-tools` options.
To echo, or not to echo, that is no longer a question.
Great!
I added the lines below to _metadata.yml in posts.

```
code-fold: true
code-tools: true

fig-width: 6
fig-height: 3.708
```

I also added the lines below to yaml header of each post which includes figures to make figures look consistent.

```
knitr: 
  opts_chunk: 
    out.width: '70%'
```

It took me four days to migrate my 13 Rmd posts and 77 md posts.
md posts were easy: just delete `tags:` and `slug:` lines. 
Rmd posts were hard, as I changed them into qmd and re-rendered.
I also added 'fig-' and 'tbl-' prefix to figure and table label.
I believe migration was the right choice, as Quarto is the future.
