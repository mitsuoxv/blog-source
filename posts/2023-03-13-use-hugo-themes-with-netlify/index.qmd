Almost four years ago, I posted [For a starter, you had better not git clone the themes](https://mitsuoxv.rbind.io/posts/2019-04-26-for-a-starter-you-had-better-not-git-clone-the-themes/). Then I wrote "don’t git clone the themes, instead download zip." As time passed, however, I felt it necessary to update the theme. So, I referred to [Host on Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/) and followed the instruction in the section "Use Hugo Themes with Netlify." So far, I failed to replace a default icon with my face, but it is OK. I would like to say "don’t git clone the themes, instead git submodule add them."

Update on 2023-03-19: I could replace a default icon with my face, when I create static/images directory in the project root, put mitsuoxv.jpeg (my face jpeg file) there, and change "logo.png" to "mitsuoxv.jpeg" in params.logo section of config.toml.
