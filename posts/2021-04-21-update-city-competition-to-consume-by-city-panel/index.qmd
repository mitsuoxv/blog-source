I have changed "by city" panel in [City Competition to Consume Shiny app](https://mitsuoxv.shinyapps.io/jp-household/) from a table to a plot.

I make this change, because I would like to make it easier to find high rank items, which citizens in each city consume relatively more in Japan. Such high rank items may inspire citizens, and contribute to city revitalization, like dumplings do for Hamamatsu-city and Utsunomiya-city.
