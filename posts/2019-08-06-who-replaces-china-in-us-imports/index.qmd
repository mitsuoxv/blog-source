US imports from China are decreasing in 2019. If trade diversion is goin on, other countries are replacing China. In [this study](https://github.com/mitsuoxv/us-tariffs-on-china/blob/master/Trade-diversion.md), I somewhat arbitrarily choose 4 candidate countries like Vietnam, Korea, Japan and Mexico, and check whether the US imports from these countries increase by HS 4 digit codes.
